#### Set the image and add volumes

**If any changes are made to the volumes or its image then the container needs to be deleted !**

In default the **basic** *image* is set to all *containers*: ![](/img/image-notice.png).
When the image is changed by the *owner* or any *administrator* of the project the *container* will be spawned from that image. Until the *container* is stopped there will be a notice warning the user about the image change: ![](/img/restart-notice.png)

![](/img/container-conf-image.png)
