Project are a good way to collaborate with each other without much restriction. Permissions on files and folders are set in a restrictive way protecting user's own work

## Permissions on the shared folder
<span id="permissions">#permissions</span>
* anyone can create new items in the main folder
* by default only the owner of the folder can delete or remove any of it content.
* by default all project collaborator can read any of the contents
* owners can change the permissions on files and folders

## Adding users to projects

## File and folder permissions within a project
Everyone can write in the root folder of a project e.g. in case of *project_shared_1* in the `projects/project_shared_1/`folder. Every collaborator can read all the folders but modify only their own folder. However the owner of the project can read and write the whole content of the project folder.
