Projects and collaboration
==================


*Projects* can be created by users and can be shared in two ways: either by inviting/adding other users or making it public and let others to join in.
A folder will be created in `/v/workdir_projects/` and `/v/report_prepare/` that is shared among collaborators. See [Folder Structure](FolderStructure/Main.md) for more.

*Projects* can be associated to multiple environments

## Roles and project scopes

Users can be administrators and collaborators. Administrators can add users to the *project*.
A *project* can be private, visible to a group or public. Users may join other users' *projects*.
