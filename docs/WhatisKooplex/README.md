Platform for exploring data, development, publishing and teaching 
=================

Kooplex is a collaborative data analytics platform which is built around the transparent shareable framework of the Jupyter ecosystem.

A number of open source and commercial platforms exist for data exploration, collaborative work and for publishing presentations. These data science environments or business intelligence softwares have various advantages and features. Kooplex is in some sense and alternative to *[JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub)*, it runs single user notebook servers ([Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) etc) but also adds a collaborative layer on top of that. Kooplex tries to be also modular and capable to incorporate other independently developed components such as cloud based file sharing ([OwnCloud](https://owncloud.org/), [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/), [SeaFile]() etc.), repositories for version controlled contents, hosting interactive reports and so on.

The motivation for Kooplex came from projects, in which users usually run dataanalysis codes from different locations than where the large datasets are. There is need for a locally functioning platforms which authorized users can access easily and do not have to switch to a new working environment or set it up again.
