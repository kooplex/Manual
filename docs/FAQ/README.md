==================

Issues, Bugs, workarounds etc.

## Login

* First sign in

At the moment each method will create an independent account and your account name depends on the chosen identification method. In the future it will be possible to connect multiple identities and always use the same account.

* Kooplex user account registration

At the moment mailing is not working and administrators don't get notified when you registered. To activate your account you will need their approval, therefore please send an email to them directly to kooplex at complex.elte.hu to notify them. Thank you!

## Duplicate of a UserCourseBinding
* When someone changes from one group to another within a course an error will occur. It is best if you notify an administrator when this occurs.

## RStudio server
* When entering into Rstudio it gives an R session Error
![Rsession](/img/rsessionerror.png)

You can safely ignore this message. In case you do notice some kind of malfunction then please, report it to the administrators!
