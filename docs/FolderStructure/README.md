Folder Structure
====

What is where?

When a *Notebook* is launched users land in the `/home` directory, which is read-only. In Jupyter one will see only `/` on the graphical interface and `/home` when using a terminal. The user's permanent private folder is the `/$USER` (in the examples `$USER` is 'wfct0p').

The rest of the folders differ in case of a [*Course container*](course.md) or a [*Project container*](project.md). Course containers are used in teaching and Project containers in research or other collaborative activities.
