Platform for exploring data, development, publishing and teaching 
=================

A number of open source and commercial platforms exist for data exploration, collaborative work and to publish presentations. These data science environments or business intelligence softwares have varying advantages and features. Kooplex is in some sense and alternative to *[JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub)*, it runs single user notebook servers ([Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) etc) and adds a collaborative layer on top of that. Kooplex tries to be also modular and capable to incorporate other independently developed components such as cloud based file sharing ([OwnCloud](https://owncloud.org/), [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/), [SeaFile]() etc.), repositories for version controlled contents, hosting interactive reports and so on.

<Access for the platform will be provided for the project participants to facilitate collaborative tool development, data exploration, analysis and visualization. 

The platform will provide a virtual space, where data from various sources can be brought together, algorithms can be developed by people from different work packages and institutions. 

The environment will provide pre-installed packages, easy interaction with code versioning system, dropbox like feature for user friendly sharing of small files, reports and results. 

The platform will provide possibility to create private and public projects, invite/authenticate partners, manage user and group access rights, attach data sources, install software packages. 

The virtualized architecture of the system will make possible to dynamically allocate compute resources according to the needs and optionally launch compute and data intensive project containers in the SELECTA cloud system. 
Beyond the larger computational capacity this solution will have the advantage that tasks that require frequent access of large data sources can be brought closer to the data archive speeding up the analysis by reducing the network traffic.   

cloud platform for data exploration, should be integrated better with ENA data hubs

To develop a small scale ecosystem where administrators/users can install state of the art packages/modules 

To develop and maintain a small scale ecosystem where users can experiment with any combination of tools without the restrictions of the policies of a large
